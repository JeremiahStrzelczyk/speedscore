| J.S.        | There were a few wrinkles in our communication. I think we were able to come together in the end to finalize a game plan, which will set us on the correct path for milestone1                                   |

### Retrospective

We did not use Zoom, we used a private discord meeting to go through what we did and what we still needed to do.

#### What went well

- Communication for the most part was quick and smooth.
- We had everything we needed by the time our demo came along however a few bugs led us to not be able to demo at 100% completeness.
- Teammates were cooperating and working together

#### What we'd like to improve

- Giving ourselves a day or two earlier to finish
- Giving everyone evenly as possible distributed points

#### Changes we plan to implement in next milestone period

- Finishing quicker
- Everyone reviewing PRs
- Work quickly but do not rush, give ourselves time

## Milestone 1 (Due 12/3)
